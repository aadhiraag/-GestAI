#  Unlock with Hand Sign

This is a fun and interactive project where you can control your computer using just your hand gestures — no clicks, no keyboard, just a webcam

Using Python, MediaPipe, and OpenCV, we detect common gestures like ✌️ peace sign or 👍 thumbs up and perform actions like:

- ✌️ Peace Sign → Unlock the screen
- 🤙 L Sign → Lock the screen
- 👋 Wave → Take a screenshot
- 👍 Thumbs Up → Increase volume
- 👎 Thumbs Down → Decrease volume

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pyautogui
